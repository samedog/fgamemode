simple gamemode daemon for franknepuplinux

This my own patched version of the 5.6.8 kernel and aims to milk every single drop of performance the system can give.
Requires ionice and renice (or equivalent busybox applets) and schedtool for SCHED_ISO (https://github.com/jlelli/schedtool-dl)

Quite similar to https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode but running in the background with automatic detection
